| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| How old are you? | 29 |
| How long have you worked at Chainge? | Startede i går. Var til samtale i sidste uge. |
| Why did you choose to apply for this job? | Fleksibilitet, kan selv vælge vagter. Penge. Fik interesse i Chainge fordi de afspejler hans værdier, f.eks. at få dieselbiler ud af byen. Der var fokus på den “tredobbelte bundlinje”, aka økonomi, miljø, socialt. |
| How/where did you find the job? | Facebook feed |
| How do you approximate your job responsibilities? | Ansvarlig overfor Chainge, fordi de er ansvarlige overfor deres partnere. Hvis han ikke gør arbejdet ordentligt, så ser Chainge dårlige ud overfor deres partnere, som betaler. Ansvarlig overfor kunderne som leveres til. Ansvarlig for ikke at fucke op. |
| How would a fuck up look? | Kører som et dumt svin; vælter på cyklen, kører folk ned, taber varer. Hvis han ikke havde pakket cyklen ordentligt, ville han ikke have det rigtige med ud på en kørsel. |
|  | Han blev overrasket over at cyklerne skal pakkes, han havde hørt at de var pakket i forvejen. Der har ikke været nogen som hjælper ham under hans første kørsel. Han har skulle sætte sig ind i deres app. |
| How’s the app usage going? | Det gik okay. Den virkede ikke optimeret til deres form for leverance. Den virker som en tredjeparts app, som er udarbejdet til frugt.dk. App’en virker påbudet frem for lavet til formålet. |
| What information do you bring with you on a ride? | Addresserne, som bliver til ruteplan / Google Maps GPS. Vareliste, hvad skal afleveres. Vogn. Noter med specifikke instrukser til de forskellige stede, som ikke er lige så godt udfyldt ifht. kundens forventninger. Instruktionerne stemmer ikke overens med hvad kunderne siger de ville have foretrukket. Han ved ikke om det er kunden der har udfyldt det forkert. |
| Where and how do you register your work hours? | Ikke endnu. Har hørt at der er en app, men ved ikke hvilken. |
| Where and how do you receive your pay check? | Har ikke fået kontrakt endnu. Forventer en bank konto overførsel. Har hørt at arbejdsperioder er 21. til 20. i måneden. |
| What happens if you are sick or unable to work? | Forventer ikke at blive betalt sygedage, og at han bare bliver hjemme når han er syg. |
| How and to who do you report it? | Ved ikke om der er en officiel måde at gøre det på, men han ville skrive/ringe til Poul. [Nævner ikke om tidsfrister osv. f.eks. før et bestemt tidspunkt på dagen] |
| What are the perks of working for Chainge? (fridge with drinks for drivers) | Sodvand. Kan leje en cykelvogn for 50 kr. hvilket er godt til at flytte ting. |
| Do you feel confident in knowing your job responsibilities and tasks? | Ja, følte sig lidt skrøbelig første dag, men her dagen efter føler han de første fuck ups er kørt igennem. |
| What could those fuck ups be? | Han skulle have taget billeder efter aflevering, og hvor de er blevet afleveret. Det var han ved at glemme ofte. GPS kan fucke. Kan fucke lidt op i pakningen, så han kunne ikke få alt det med han måske burde. Han skimmede hurtigt listen over hvad skulle med. Det kan blive forvirrende. Det er ikke super kompleks, men det skal gøre systematisk for at undgå negative konsekvenser. |
| Are there other fuck ups? | Var ved at glemme et stop på ruten. Kom til at krydse det forkerte af. Vil gerne gøre det hurtigt, men godt og grundigt især første gang. Der er et høj detaljegrad krav, og det er let at lave fejl. |
| Do you know what an onboarding process is? (we describe the onboarding process as the very first contact with Chainge to you as an experienced driver at Chainge.) | Ja |
| Describe the onboarding process for Chainge. | Jeg fandt et opslag, skrev en kort mail til dem med sit CV, Torben ringede samme dag og sagde hans profil var interessant og de aftale en dag hurtigt. Han kom ind og snakkede med Poul om cyklen, og med Torben om mulighederne i virksomheden. Snakkede om sygedage, app til planlægning af vagter, og kort intro til hvordan det fungerer. Konstant asterisk om at Chaigne er et startup, og at det derfor kan være kaotisk/i ændring. |
| How was the first day? | Lærte at pakke vognen, at der var racks som optimerede pakningen osv. Blev påmindet om at være søde overfor kunderne. Det er lidt ad hoc, learning by doing. |
| How did the onboarding process feel to you? | Jeg synes at jeg nogenlunde fik det af vide jeg skulle bruge. Tænkte med det samme at der manglede nogle informationer og noget struktur, samt at der var nogle best-practices som skulle nedskrives, især ifht. pakningen. Der er 2 hold til pakningen, og det kunne være fedt med noget formalisering af deres samarbejde. |
| What was things you like about the process? | Synes ikke jobbet er komplekst, og er derfor glad for at onboarding processen ikke føles som 2 ugers lektier. |
| What do you not like about the process? | Glæder sig til at se vagt booking app’en, om der f.eks. er kamp om vagterne. Glæder sig til at se om der er en WhatsApp gruppe. |
| Was there anything you missed? Information, tools, guidance? | At onboarding var mere struktureret, så det ikke tog så meget tid for Poul, fordi Poul har travlt. |
| How familiar were you with traffic rules before starting? Were you taught any rules after starting? | Har kørekort, så han har personligt styr på trafikreglerne, men har ikke info fra Chainge. Blev spurgt af Chainge om han havde kørekort. Fik at vide han skulle række helt ud med armen når han skal signalere på cyklen. |
| What challenges did you have? How did you solve those challenges? | Vognen er større end man tror |
| Would you recommend the job to a friend? | Ja, ud fra arbejdsmiljøet |
| If you should quit your job, what would be the reason? | Når måske sit limit hvis vejret er for lort |
