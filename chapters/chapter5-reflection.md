# Reflection {#sec:reflection}

<!-- Should be one page -->

<!-- Common notes -->
* Not an iterative approach because the solution is not tested on users/non-users (Emma)
* Used double diamond model as 1) we needed to create prototye and 2) we needed a common language to understand where we were in the process and where we were headed.
* Why did we do what we do

Jacobs and Frickel (2009) have reviewed various studies of interdisciplinarity. Those studies were written under the assumption that little diffusion of ideas across disciplinary boundaries happens, and thereby advocate for interdisciplinarity to operate under the assumption that disciplines are disconnected from each other. Purely disciplinary work would therefore inhibit innovation [@jacobs2009assessment]. In contrast, Jacobs and Frickel (2009) argue that different disciplines inform each other, even when not actively collaborating, and should therefore be viewed as networks.

Interdisciplinary teamwork forces us to reflect on things we take for granted within our own field of study. In relation, Bechky (2003) state that “knowledge is constructed within a particular social context” [@bechky2003sharing, p. 313]. In the project. Our own situated knowledge brought into this project from our various disciplines gave rise to misunderstandings. The discussions in our team were therefore characterized by different disciplines trying to explain their understanding of the problem or context. Through these talks where key differences in our disciplinary context were highlighted, we built a shared understanding of the case to work from. [@bechky2003sharing, p. 324]. 

As an example of a misunderstanding that lead to an explainatory discussion, the term *implementation* varried from a technical term in coding to an organisational proces. Other examples include digital tools from our various disciplines, that were considered - and in some cases implemented - as tools in our project work. 

This view on our disciplines as interconnected networks of knowledge, and our experience of creating shared knowledge within the specific context of our team have lead us to wonder if the interconnectivity between our disciplines in part could be explained by the shared institution of ITU.

When visualizing our knowledgebases as T-shaped, we see this course as strengthening the general knowledge of each other's disciplines and thus aid in preparing us for future interdisciplinary collaborations.

- **Shared vocabulary:** we needed to agree on the meaning of terms. I.e *implementation* meant something different to all of us.
- **Knowledge:** we shared our theory, but only that which we could back up with sources.
- **Process:** more ethnographic than Computer Science. more technical than Business or Design. different tools and experience with tools.
