# Reflection {#sec:reflection}

<!-- Common notes
* Not an iterative approach because the solution is not tested on users/non-users (Emma)
* Used double diamond model as 1) we needed to create prototye and 2) we needed a common language to understand where we were in the process and where we were headed.
* Why did we do what we do

Jacobs and Frickel (2009) have reviewed various studies of interdisciplinarity. Those studies were written under the assumption that little diffusion of ideas across disciplinary boundaries happens, and thereby advocate for interdisciplinarity to operate under the assumption that disciplines are disconnected from each other. Purely disciplinary work would therefore inhibit innovation [@jacobs2009assessment]. In contrast, Jacobs and Frickel (2009) argue that different disciplines inform each other, even when not actively collaborating, and should therefore be viewed as networks.

Interdisciplinary teamwork forces us to reflect on things we take for granted within our own field of study. In relation, Bechky (2003) state that “knowledge is constructed within a particular social context” [@bechky2003sharing, p. 313]. In the project. Our own situated knowledge brought into this project from our various disciplines gave rise to misunderstandings. The discussions in our team were therefore characterized by different disciplines trying to explain their understanding of the problem or context. Through these talks where key differences in our disciplinary context were highlighted, we built a shared understanding of the case to work from. [@bechky2003sharing, p. 324]. 

As an example of a misunderstanding that lead to an explainatory discussion, the term *implementation* varried from a technical term in coding to an organisational proces. Other examples include digital tools from our various disciplines, that were considered - and in some cases implemented - as tools in our project work. 

This view on our disciplines as interconnected networks of knowledge, and our experience of creating shared knowledge within the specific context of our team have lead us to wonder if the interconnectivity between our disciplines in part could be explained by the shared institution of ITU.

Aagaard-Hansen describe the levels of cross-disciplinary teamwork as being a process moving from multidisciplinarity into interdisciplinarity  [@aagaard2007challenges, p.425-426]. When looking at our teamwork we recognize this process, where we moved more into interdisciplinarity through our colaborative work. This process of learning from each other and creating a shared knowledge base also provide a foundation for future interdisciplinary teamwork as our theoretical perspective and experience can leverage us into future colaborations.

<!-- Thor 
- **Shared vocabulary:** we needed to agree on the meaning of terms. I.e *implementation* meant something different to all of us.
- **Knowledge:** we shared our theory, but only that which we could back up with sources.
- **Process:** more ethnographic than Computer Science. more technical than Business or Design. different tools and experience with tools.

We entered this course with various academic backgrounds and different views on cross-disciplinarity. Aagaard-Hansen [-@aagaard2007challenges, pp.425-426] describes the levels of cross-disciplinary teamwork as being a process moving from multi-disciplinarity into interdisciplinarity. When looking at our teamwork we recognise this process, where we moved more towards interdisciplinarity through our collaborative work.

We were challenged by the misalignment of our disciplinary terminologies. This manifested in our perception of *implementation*, which varied from programming to an organisational process. Beckhy [-@bechky2003sharing, p. 313] states that *“knowledge is constructed within a particular social context”*. As the social context of our team was new, we had to create a shared understanding from where we could build our future work.

We chose an interdisciplinary approach to research and explore the context by synthesising the shared knowledge between our disciplines into an inquiry process of observation and interviews. The alternative would be a multi-disciplinary approach with only the ethnographically-oriented disciplines conducting the inquiry. Jacobs and Frickel [-@jacobs2009assessment] argue that disciplines should be viewed as interconnected networks that inform each other rather than disconnected silos of knowledge. We have pursued a collaborative approach where our disciplines have influenced each other, instead of dividing the workload among us based on our respective disciplines.

Aagaard-Hansen [-@aagaard2007challenges, p.426] defines the highest level of cross-disciplinary teamwork as transdisciplinary teamwork. We could argue that we have reached transdisciplinary because we have built a shared conceptual framework, using theories, concepts and approaches from our various disciplines to address the problem. In contrast, we could argue that our work does not transcend our various disciplines to create new shared disciplinary knowledge.

We would argue that we have reached the interdisciplinary level of cross-disciplinarity, as defined by Aagaard-Hansen [-@aagaard2007challenges] since we have succeeded in bridging our disciplines through this project. Achieving interdisciplinarity has given us a model for moving towards a shared understanding of knowledge, concepts and methodology, which is applicable in future cross-disciplinary teamwork.

<!--Early discussions in our team were therefore characterised by different disciplines trying to explain their understanding of the problem or context. Through these talks where key differences in our disciplinary context were highlighted, we started building a shared understanding of the case to work from [@bechky2003sharing, p.324].-->
