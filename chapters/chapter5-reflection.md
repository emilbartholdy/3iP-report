# Reflection {#sec:reflection}

<!-- Should be one page -->

<!-- Common notes -->
* Not an iterative approach because the solution is not tested on users/non-users (Emma)
* Used double diamond model as 1) we needed to create prototye and 2) we needed a common language to understand where we were in the process and where we were headed.
* Why did we do what we do

Jacobs and Frickel (2009) have reviewed various studies of interdisciplinarity, and ... little diffusion of ideas across disciplinary boundaries. These studies advocate for interdisciplinarity to operate under the assumption that disciplines are disconnected from each other and inhibit innovation [@jacobs2009assessment]. In contrast, Jacobs and Frickel (2009) argue that different disciplines inform each other when collaborating and should therefore be viewed as networks.

Interdisciplinary teamwork forces us to reflect on things we take for granted within our own field of study. In relation, Bechky (2003) state that “knowledge is constructed within a particular social context” [@bechky2003sharing, p. 313]. In the project. Our own situated knowledge brought into this project from our various disciplines gave rise to misunderstandings. The discussions in our team were therefore characterized by different disciplines trying to explain their understanding of the problem or context. Through these talks where key differences in our disciplinary context were highlighted, we built a shared understanding of the case [@bechky2003sharing, p. 324].

- **Shared vocabulary:** we needed to agree on the meaning of terms. I.e *implementation* meant something different to all of us.
- **Knowledge:** we shared our theory, but only that which we could back up with sources.
- **Process:** more ethnographic than Computer Science. more technical than Business or Design. different tools and experience with tools.

When visualizing our knowledgebases as T-shaped, we see this course as strengthening the general knowledge of each other's disciplines and thus aid in preparing us for future interdisciplinary collaborations.
