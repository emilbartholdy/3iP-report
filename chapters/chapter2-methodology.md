# Methodology {#sec:methods}

Our process for adressing the research questions was structured using the Double Diamond model, as described by Norman, D [-@norman2013design, pp. 220-221]. In [@fig:double_diamond] we see which methods was used in a given phase. Broadly, we used observation and interviews for exploring fundamental issues. For converging on the problems experienced we used color coding to see which problems was experienced by study participants. With a focused problem, we explored several ideas in an ideation workshop using brainstorming and sketching. In a group discussion, we converged on an idea for further prototyping that was to be implented in code. We chose an idea which was 1) grounded in empirical data and 2) realistically could be implemented within project time restrictions. A high fidelity prototype was coded and tested on potential users from ITU. Each method is explained in more depth in the following sections.

<!-- Addressing the research questions required gaining insights into Chainge as an organisation and collective of workers. These insights were obtained through a qualitative assessment of the work culture and employees’ responsibilities, by conducting three interviews with newly hired (less than four weeks in their position) Drivers, and then analysing the collected data. <!-- Add more about what we did after data analysis...? -->

## Interviews {#sec:interviews}

As part of the empirical gathering, we interviewed Torben, the Founder and CEO of Chainge, to get an understanding of the business in general and the onboarding process. The interview was informal and involved an introduction to the facilities at the headquarters and the electric cargo bikes. To remember the context of the headquarters we took a series of pictures (see [@fig:chainge_headquarters]). Due to the nature of the interview, we had not created an interview guide. The interview was informative and provided a great understanding of the business and strategy. The session with Torben also had a positive impact on our collaboration due to the informal talk in between case related subjects. Nevertheless, the interview supported us in clarifying and guiding us towards the next step in the process.

The Head Quarters of Chainge
:::

We wanted to interview Drivers working at Chainge to learn more about their work tasks and the onboarding process. Torben from Chainge assisted in arranging interviews with newly hired Drivers a week later. We wanted to interview Drivers that had recently experienced the onboarding process or were in the middle of the onboarding. We conducted three interviews with new Drivers that had worked at Chainge for less than four weeks. The three Drivers had worked at Chainge for one week, two weeks and three weeks respectively.

The interviews were conducted at Chainge’s headquarters to make it convenient for the interviewees. Prior to the interviews, we created an interview guide to structure and facilitate the interviews. This guide was semi-structured, which is more flexible for structured interviews but not as loosely structured as unstructured interviews [@bryman2016social]. The interview guide provided flexibility for questions that suddenly arose but at the same time managed the interview in a way so we did not deviate from the planned questions.

## Colour coding of data {#sec:colour_coding}

Numerous frameworks and tools exist for grouping interview data in categories. We chose an accessible and visual methodological approach of highlighting words and sentences with colors, each color corresponding to a category in our coding format table [@tbl:colortable]. It illustrates the colours and the corresponding definitions.

| Colour | Definition                                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Green  | Positive aspects of the Drivers' job           |
| Yellow | General knowledge about work practices         |
| Red    | Challenges/insecurities experienced by Drivers |

: Colour Coding Table {#tbl:colortable}

<!--REMOVE
This approach is inspired by Grounded Theory, which advocates for grounding research approaches in empirical data at every step of the process [@charmaz2006constructing]. Grounded Theory advocates not only leveraging interview data as a source of knowledge, but also as a starting point for conducting further ethnographic research. This is known as deductive determination, wherein the research focus is determined by deducing the main points in the data [@charmaz2006constructing].

The aim is to improve the onboarding by structuring relevant information for the Drivers. We decided to highlight data in relation to the different categories to prioritise information relevant for the final solution. -->

The three color codings were chosen, as we would be able to clearly highly positive aspects of the onboarding process that should not changed (green code), information that might be needed in the corresponding solution (yellow code) and challenges and/or insecurities that need to be addressed in the onboarding process (red code).


## Participant observation {#sec:participant_obs}

As part of our empirical gathering, we have conducted participant observation. Spradley has categorised different degrees of participant observation. We utilised the type of participation classified as passive participation. ~~Spradley applies the insider/outsider perspective to explain the degree of participation~~ [@spradley1980observation].

The person being observed was one of the interview respondents that was also a newly hired Driver. This observation was arranged during our interview with the Driver. The Driver agreed to being observed while driving a delivery route for Chainge. The Driver was followed on bike by two of the students from the group and was observed while performing his work tasks. ~~The students did not seek to maintain a balance between an insider/outsider perspective as they merely behaved as outsiders to observe from the outside~~. The students drove after the Driver so they were present at the scene but they did not participate in performing the work tasks. We decided to pursue participant observation with the aim of exploring tacit knowledge about the work tasks that was not vocalised during the interview.

Additionally, we wanted to take pictures and videos as they could be useful later on and as a point of reference for the remaining students that did not participate.

## Ideation Workshop {#sec:ideation_workshop}

Grounded in the themes identified through our category-coded interview data, we conducted an internal ideation workshop with brainstorming as the main focus, wherein we explored the design openings and potential solutions. Our approach was to ignore the technological possibilities in situ, as well as any constraints, leveraging a user-centric approach instead. In this process we emphasised the benefits a solution would have on Chainge employees, based on the problems they vocalised in our interviews. <!--insert reference-->.

Kolko describes how brainstorming emerged as a playful and creative way of problem solving. Four principles are relevant in a brainstorming session: to avoid criticisms, encourage crazy ideas, produce a variety of ideas and utilise the ideas from the team members to build upon to extend ideas [@kolko2018designthinking]. According to Kolko, empathy is the foundation of participatory design practice.

We brainstormed themes on a whiteboard to figure out what should characterise the solution. Afterwards, we individually marked three words each that we found the most important. It became evident through this process that the central theme of our solution should be the existence and contextual accessibility of structured, standardised information on work practices and responsibilities for Chainge drivers. We have strived to be empathic in the brainstorming within the group to be open-minded and explorative when being presented to ideas.

Reflecting on our sketching process led to us discussing potential sources of inspiration. One of our sketches illustrated an e-learning platform, and it reminded us of Apple's Developer application [@fig:developer], which consists of a list of links leading to pages containing a video, description and resources with references. We sampled this for the development of our prototype, as it shares our design goals. <!-- describe these goals? -->

## Prototyping {#sec:prototyping}

Our prototyping process began with a discussion of which elements of the design should be emphasized or de-emphasized. Because our prototype was a small component in the larger context of a platform, the operational medium had to be perceivable as one component of many collective components.

Bucheanau and Suri raise the notion that a prototype is any medium produced to communicate or explore ideas [@buchenau2000prototyping]. Our goal was to not only communicate amongst ourselves a representation of our collective ideas, but to also communicate to and explore it with potential end-users.

Stotlerman et al. argue that prototypes manifest in three dimensions: medium, resolution, and scope. Our prototype reflects these dimensions by being consciously shaped as a digital platform, with a high degree of fidelity, and a scope fixed to the learning component. We chose to build a high-fidelity prototype based on our low-fidelity sketches, because we were less interested in co-designing with users, and more interested in presenting a highly-structured and accessible platform [@lim2008anatomy].

## Evaluation {#sec:evaluation}

We decided to test the prototype with a individual that do not work at Chainge. A technical description of the prototype is outlined in [@sec:technical_impl]. The target group of the prototype is new Drivers, therefore we did not find it relevant to test it on existing employees as they are potentially biased from their experience working at Chainge. We tested the platform on a individual studying at ITU. The test was mostly concerned with a proof of concept and to identify potential pain points. We wanted to explore if the prototype was easy to navigate. Additionally, we wanted to show the video on the platform to get information regarding if it showcases the different work tasks that a Driver can be presented with.
