# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues globally and demands action today. Organisations increasingly focus on sustainable initiatives, which contribute to transforming societies towards sustainability [@bradbury1999].

Chainge is an organisation contributing to this transformation. Chainge was established in 2019 by Paul Blakemore and Torben Damgaard Nielsen who promote sustainable goods transportation. The ambition for Chainge is to reduce the number of diesel vans transporting goods in Copenhagen by offering a sustainable alternative that reduces particle pollution and CO~2~ emissions. Chainge does this by utilising electric cargo bikes to deliver packages from Business-to-Business and Business-to-Consumers [@chaingeA2021].

Chainge's mission aligns with FN's Sustainability Goals, more specifically number 11 [@chaingeB2021] and number 13. Goal number 11 entails promoting sustainable cities and communities, while goal number 13 entails curbing climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions [@un2021sustainable]. Sustainability is thus deeply embedded within Chainge's business model and strategy.

## Case Description {#sec:case_description}

One of the primary concerns of Chainge is to increase their drop-off rate for the new bike drivers. Every minute during delivery has an impact on the profitability of Chainge's business model and cost for its customers. In this regard, it is vital that new drivers are onboarded as efficiently as possible. The overall goal of this project is therefore to optimise the drop-off rate of deliveries by focusing on optimising the onboarding process.

The scope of the project is to improve the onboarding process for new *Drivers*, as the bike drivers are called. The current onboarding process was presented by the Founder and CEO of the company, Torben, and was described as an unstructured process that could be improved. Nonetheless, the flow of the process and the sequence of actions seemed to be working well. Therefore, our focus is not to redesign the entire process but to explore what and how information should be delivered to the new employees at the beginning of their employment.

Furthermore, we decided on this problem area because we identified an opportunity for combining our competencies to accommodate Chainge's need to increase the drop-off rate in combination with onboarding new Drivers. 

## Research Statement {#sec:research_statement}

To focus our research at Chainge, we have formulated two research questions. Research question 1 is problem-oriented while research question 2 focuses on possible solutions to problems found in research question 1.

* *Research question 1*: What challenges affect the Drivers in the onboarding process at Chainge? 
* *Research question 2*: How might we improve the onboarding process to make it more efficient for the Drivers and Chainge?
