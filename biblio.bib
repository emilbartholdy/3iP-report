 abstract = {A sustainable society can persist over generations, being farseeing, flexible, and wise enough to nourish its physical and social systems of support. Sustainable businesses are a key element in transforming society toward sustainability. For firms willing to inquire into the challenge presented by sustainable development, the journey ahead may involve radical transformation not only of organizational practices, but also of the ways of thinking that led to those practices in the first place. The Natural Step, a Stockholm-based environmental education organization has partnered with a number of major businesses in Sweden to promote organizational transformation as an important element in the societal shift toward sustainable development. This article examines the Natural Step--its philosophy, history, practices, successes, possible limitations, and application to firms pursuing sustainability.},

  abstract = {The role of prototypes is well established in the field of HCI and Design. A lack of knowledge, however, about the fundamental nature of prototypes still exists. Researchers have attempted to identify different types of prototypes, such as low- vs. high-fidelity prototypes, but these attempts have centered on evaluation rather than support of design exploration. There have also been efforts to provide new ways of thinking about the activity of using prototypes, such as experience prototyping and paper prototyping, but these efforts do not provide a discourse for understanding fundamental characteristics of prototypes. In this article, we propose an anatomy of prototypes as a framework for prototype conceptualization. We view prototypes not only in their role in evaluation but also in their generative role in enabling designers to reflect on their design activities in exploring a design space. We base this framework on the findings of two case studies that reveal two key dimensions: prototypes as filters and prototypes as manifestations. We explain why these two dimensions are important and how this conceptual framework can benefit our field by establishing more solid and systematic knowledge about prototypes and prototyping.},

  abstract = { This article draws together disparate research and theorizing on interdisciplinarity. We first describe widespread efforts to promote interdisciplinarity in U.S. universities and critically examine the assumptions underlying these initiatives. Next, we present a cross-sectional view of interdisciplinary communication, knowledge diffusion, research assessment, and interdisciplinary research centers. We then describe research and theories that provide historical perspectives on the disciplinary system, interdiscipline formation, applied and professional fields, and institutional fragmentation. We present original findings on the prevalence of research centers, faculty hiring patterns in hybrid fields, and the diffusion of research across disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. The review concludes with a critical summary and suggestions for future research. }
